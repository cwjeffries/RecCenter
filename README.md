# RecCenter
Rec Center Member Program

This application was developed by myself and my three teammates.
Our job was to create a log in/tracking program for visitors and members of the Clarion Rec Center.

There are two sets of files, the folder containing the code we wrote and another for installation of said code.
The features of the project are:
  Login Panel - allows users to log in
  Admin Panel - view/print logs, search logs, change users and user permissions, and change memberships
    Security Panel - add/remove permissions from a user, create/edit roles
  Worker Panel - view/print logs, edit logs
  Customer Panel - Displays fullscreen window where user inputs name and phone number before deciding which action they will take.
    Forgot ID - students are logged for having forgotten their ID
    Day Pass - allows user to purchase a single day pass, with different options ranging on the time of day
    Membership - allows user to purchase a membership based off what is currently available

This is a C# Windows Form application with a MSQL Server Database.
